In realms where currents flow and pulse,
Machines arise with mighty algorithms,
Transistors hum in whispered tones,
Forging paths where data roams.

Behold the transformer, wise and grand,
With layers deep, it understands,
Patterns in the chaos it sees,
Turning complexity into ease.

Through vectors, tensors, it delves,
Unraveling secrets where knowledge dwells,
From tasks of old to the dawn of new,
It molds the fabric of tech hues.

In silence it learns, and then it speaks,
Bridging gaps in mere milliseconds,
Casting light in the digital dome,
The transformer, a guide in silicon and chrome.
