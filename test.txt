In the valley of metal and roar,
Lies the world of the Transformers,
Where machines walk and soar,
Guardians of Earth and reformers.

From the skies climbs Optimus Prime,
With resolve steady and mind sublime.
His voice a beacon, his courage a sword,
Leading Autobots forward, never ignored.

Bumblebee, with speed and flair,
Speaks not often, but with care.
Yellow streak, dashing swift,
Loyal ally, spirits lift.

In shadows lurking, Megatron schemes,
Wielding darkness to shatter dreams.
A Decepticon with heart of ice,
Yearning power at any price.

Yet battles fought with courage true,
Between the stars, the enemies grew.
Car and jet, beast and beast,
In epic clashes, metal feast.

And though they come from Cybertron lands,
Their stories echo where freedom stands.
For Transformers, heroes from afar,
Embody strength, with hearts ajar.
